# 📊 Data Analysis Notebook (Python)

This repository contains a Python-based data analysis notebook that demonstrates structured analytical thinking, data preprocessing, and step-by-step exploration of a problem using code.

The project is presented as a **portfolio example** and focuses on reasoning, clarity, and correctness rather than production deployment or large-scale systems.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The notebook walks through a complete analytical workflow, starting from raw data handling and progressing through analysis, experimentation, and conclusions.

The emphasis is on:
- Understanding the problem and assumptions
- Cleaning and preparing data
- Applying analytical or algorithmic methods
- Interpreting results in a clear and reasoned way

The work is intentionally kept in a single Jupyter Notebook to make the thought process easy to follow.

## 📓 Notebook Structure

The notebook is organized into logical sections:

- **Problem Definition**  
  Description of the task, goals, and assumptions.

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
  Reading the data, cleaning it, and transforming it into a usable format.

- **Analysis / Computation**  
  Applying analytical, statistical, or algorithmic logic to the data.

- **Experiments & Results**  
  Evaluating different scenarios, parameters, or approaches.

- **Conclusions**  
  Summary of findings and insights derived from the analysis.

Each section builds on the previous one in a linear and readable manner.
